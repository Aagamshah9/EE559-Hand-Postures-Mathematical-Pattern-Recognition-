## Including:
    Feature Extraction
    Pre-processing  
    Feature Dimensionality Adjustment  
    Cross Validation
    Classification  
    Result Interpretation  

    Program platform: Python  
    Required: sklearn, tkinter



## Installations
  The code comes with Graphical User Interface which makes it easier to interpret the results using different classifiers and other techniques. GUI requires tkinter
    Tkinter comes pre-installed with the Python installer binaries for Mac OS X and the Windows platform. So if you install                   Python from the [official binaries ](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
for Mac OS X or Windows platform, you are good to go with Tkinter.
     
For Debian versions of Linux you have to install it manually by using the following commands.
`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

## Usage
Please make sure you have all the above libraries installed (including tkinter for GUI). Please change the path of train and test datasets in HandPosturesMain.py file in the MainFunction(). 
Execute Entry_Point.py file in the Terminal, a GUI will pop up where you can select different Preprocessing, Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and obtain the results on different classifiers. Please feel free to contact us if you face any problem while executing the program.
